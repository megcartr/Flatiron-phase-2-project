# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Health tracker is a diary in which you can track your daily health practices. There is a fitness section that includes different forms of exercises. You can submit the duration of your workout under the exercise that you have done for the day. There is also a nutrition section where you will keep track of how many fruits and vegetables you have had for the day as well as how many glasses of water. Keep track of your health practices is a great way to hold yourself accountable each day.
